Technological advancements do not involve uncertainities, they only contibute towards the increase in production, therefore some parameter of time can be used used to study the effect of technology on yield, whereas the weather conditions have always been an uncontrolled source for the prediction of yield.\nBut due to the latest advancements, weather forecast has been reliable and accurate.\nThis makes the whole idea of predicting agricultural yield acceptable.\n\n## Data Collection/ Source of the Data\nWe wanted to know much India has progressed since its independence and the formation of Republic of India in 1950. \nThe Indian Agriclture and Climate Data set we are using is from the dataset compiled by Duke university. \"Information about data for development research\". \nThe database provides district level data on agriculture and climate in India from 1957/58 through 1986/87. The dataset includes information on\n1. Area planted, production and farm harvest prices for five major and fifteen minor crops.\n2. Areas under irrigated and high-yielding varieties (HYV) for major crops.\n3. Data on agricultural inputs, such as, fertilizers, bullocks and tractors - in both quantity and price terms\n4. Agricultural labor, cultivators, wages and factory earnings, rural population and literacy proportion.\n5. Meteorological station level climate data (average climate over 30 year period)\n6. Soil data \n\n\n## Objectives\n\n1. Predict the crop yield for major crops in one state based on weather conditions.\n2. Recommend high yield variety for every district in the state.\n\n## Data Description\n\nApart from basic ID's the important features in the dataset we used in this analysis are\n1. STATENAM - Name of the state\n2. DISTNAME - Name of the district\n3. ACROP - Area of the crop planted(number*1000 ha)\n4. QCROP - Production of the crop(number*1000 tonnes)\n5. PCROP - Price of the crop(Rupees/quintal)\n6. RNMONTH - Rainfall in mm for every month\n7. TNMONTH - Temperature in degree celcius for every month\n8. YEAR - 1956-1987\n\nFor more detailed description of the data https://ipl.econ.duke.edu/dthomas/dev_data/datafiles/india_agric_climate.htm\n\n\n## Preprocessing \nThe dataset provided was in cfm format(Coldfusion Markup Language) and each cfm file is a year's worth of data.\nEach file contains a contains a continuous list of space-separated values; these are observations for 271 districts and 227 variables per year.\n\ncfm files were converted to text files. With the help of STATA software application, we converted .txt files to .dta files, finally used pandas library to convert .dta to .csv files.\n\nSTATA produced csv files based on the year of data. With the help of a small python script, we were able to merge all the files into a single csv file. This file was loaded into spark for analysis. \n\nWe have used Pyspark to remove unwanted data from the csv file. \nDue to inconsitencies in data from 1950 to 1955. We decided not use it for analysis in this report. \n\n## Data Analysis\n\n## Analysis 1:\n\nWhich States to Consider for the chosen Crops?\n\nBasic objective is to maximize the yield production.\nIn our dataset we have data from 1956-87\nSo we chose to plot the above graphs for 1956, 1966,1976 and 1986\nIn 1956 - Top 3 highest Rice Yield is from the states - West Bengal,Tamil Nadu and Bihar\n          Lowest 3 Yield from Punjab, Haryana, Rajastan\n          \nSimilarly for the years 1966, 1976,1986 The top and lowest yields are as follows\n1966- High - West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Low - Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan\n1976- High - West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Low - Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan\n1988- High - West Bengal, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Low - Maharashtra ,Gujarat, Rajasthan\n\nNot only should we cold we consider the Production but also the should consider the Area the crops were planted in.\n\nFor this the results for the above years is as follows.\n1956 - High - Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar and Low - Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan\n1966 - High - Orissa, West Benagl, Bihar and Low - Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan\n1976 - High - Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar and Low - MadhyaPradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan\n1986 - High - West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and Low - Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan.\n\nFrom the above analysis it is clear that  West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar have highest area allotted for Rice plantation and also had highest yield among others states.\n\nSimilar Analysis was done for other crops and decided to use.\nWest_Bengal - For Rice\nUttar_Pradesh - For Sugar\nPunjab - For Cotton\nPunjab - For Wheat\n\nPlots for the above analysis are in the folder with file names as crop names\n\n## Analysis 2\n\nThe cost per quintal values are plotted against the years for crops corresponding to the states of their high production and low production, no big difference in the price of the crop for that particular year, but with the increase in years the price increased(with some dips, because of few nulls in the data).\n","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2019-10-24T05:16:59+0000","config":{"tableHide":false,"editorSetting":{"language":"markdown","editOnDblClick":true,"completionSupport":false,"completionKey":"TAB"},"colWidth":12,"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","fontSize":9,"editorHide":true,"results":{},"enabled":true},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<div class=\"markdown-body\">\n<h1>CS534: EXPLORING THE AGRICULTURE IN INDIA USING SPARK</h1>\n<p><strong>Omkar Asawale (osa20)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pranita Eugena Burani (peb63)</strong> </p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Agriculture plays a vital role in Indian Economy.<br/>It contributes about 18% towards Annual GDP, 70% of jobs in rural areas are agriculture dependend.<br/>Crop Yield in any country mainly depends on technological advancements and weather variability.
